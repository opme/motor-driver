# TMC6200 Gate Driver

Design uses TMC6200 gate driver 

Universal high voltage BLDC/PMSM/Servo MOSFET 3-halfbridge gate-driver with in line motor current sensing. External MOSFETs for up to 100A motor current. 3 Floating Sense Amplifiers with programmable gain (5, 10, 20)

Integrated current sense amplifiers eliminate costly sense amplifiers required for FOC controllers (recommended use for applications up to 10A, use external precision amplifiers for higher current with low sense resistor values)

THE TMC6200 OFFERS TWO BASIC MODES OF OPERATION: 

MODE 1: Stand-alone driver with pin configuration 
Enable this mode by tying low pin SPE. The interface pins allow a number of different settings for
BBM generation and sense amplifier amplification control. 

MODE 2: SPI controlled 
This mode allows detailed control over the protection, diagnostic and control features, e.g. for tuning
overcurrent detection. Enable this mode by tying high pin SPE.

# Design Discussion

The TMC6200 IC current sensing is limited to 10A.  The thermal design of the PCB is also designed for 10A max current.  The 10A limit is chosen to allow full SMT and single side hole through components with 1oz copper.  

Heatsink over the gate driver and mosfets is required over a certain current.  28x28x20 is a standard heat sink size and is added to the pcb using silicon thermal glue.

Initial parts were selected based on the Trinamic reference designs that I have copied into this git repo.

Footprint for capacitors and resitors choosen as 0603 to make it easier to manufacture with low end SMD machines.

Parts are selected that are available in quantity from various resellers due to current chip shortage.  Avoided any parts that were only available in small quantities or not in stock.
